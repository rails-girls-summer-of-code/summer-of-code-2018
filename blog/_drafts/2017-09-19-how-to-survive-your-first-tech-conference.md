As coding newbies immersed in the intensive [Rails Summer of Code](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/), Jessica and I haven’t had the opportunity or finances to attend too many tech conferences yet.  But the RGSoC program really does encourage participants to attend at least one conference over the course of the summer.  [Fullstack Fest (FSF) 2017](https://2017.fullstackfest.com/agenda/) was the one that we chose to attend during our Rails Girls Summer of Code, and it … was… awesome!

We’ve had quite a few people asking how we got tickets and what our overall experience was like, so I put together this handy guide:

<br>

## Tip #1: Put together a short list

There are a mind-boggling number of tech events, conferences and workshops, making it difficult to pinpoint the ones in your discipline, country or even the same continent.  Here are a few lists that I found helpful:
Free conferences for 2017 RGSoC teams (a big plus for us!)
Conferences with discount (or free) for those that apply via Women Who Code
A 2017 comprehensive list of conferences, as well as those recommended for beginner developers, compiled by Medium

Word of mouth is great as well - ask your developer friends and colleagues which conferences they’ve attended in the past and would recommend.  For us, our lovely RGSoC supervisor Nynne highly recommended FSF, as she had also attended and loved the experience when she was a RGSoC participant a few years ago.  And so, Full Stack Fest 2017 was placed on the top of our short list!

So put together a short list of conferences that you want to attend.  Then, make it happen!

<br>

## Tip #2: Look for free tickets!

One of the advantages of being a female developer as well as a visible minority is that conferences and companies will sometime offer you a ticket - for free!  

Quite frankly, there was no way we could afford the regular price of 650 EUR for the entire week.  So we set about shamelessly asking as many people as we could whether there were free or discounted tickets set aside for students, junior developers, and/or female developers.  Fortunately, the good folks at FSF put us in touch with the Barcelona Women Who Code community.  We filled out a form explaining why we’d like to attend and how we would benefit from the conference.  A few weeks later, we got an email reply saying that we could attend for free! Woohoo!

<br>

## Tip #3:  Get Organized

I mean that in every way possible.  A multi-day conference goes by fast, and you want to make sure you know about every speaker, workshop and post-conference events in order to decide what to prioritize.  For FSF, it’s an intense 2 days of Back End talks, a break in the middle, followed by 2 days of Front End talks.  Each day has workshops sporadically planned while the talks are happening.  

For myself it was important to choose which talks and workshops were my top priority to attend for each day.  Also good to plan which mornings you can arrive late in case you had too much fun at the post-conference evening festivities ;)  

Make sure you arrive on time for when the conference begins, as that’s when a lot of highlights are planned.  I was blown away by the two keynote speakers (who happened to be phenomenal & internet-famous female developers) Karissa McKelvey and Jenn Schiffer, who talked about the ground-breaking projects they were working on and how they became the developers that we know today.

<br>

## Tip #4: Get Social!

The power of Twitter is amazing these conferences. It’s the medium used to spark discussions, pose questions and share news.  You can easily meet and chat with anyone - conference organizers, speakers, other attendees - and arrange meetings in real life.  This happened to us when we tweeted that we were Rails Girls attending the conference. We got so much love - the support for Rails Girls and people who wanted to hear about our project was so overwhelmingly positive!

We got to meet with Rails Girls workshop organizers and RGSoC coaches from Berlin, Philadelphia and UK.  A lot of people have been working to build the Rails community in their own cities and wanted to know how our project and careers as junior developers were coming along.  It was the perfect opportunity to break out these fantastic stickers that Jessica had made for our new international Rails friends :)

##  Tip # 5: Do you something you might regret

In this case, it means volunteer for a lightning talk.  At the end of each 2-day session at FSF,  there were 10 people that volunteered to give 5 min talks about anything and everything.  Some of the organizers encouraged us to give it a shot - but we declined, having never even seen one of these talks before and also feeling like we didn’t have a topic to offer since we were so junior.  But now thinking about it, people at FSF were so interested in our perspectives and experiences that I really do feel like we could have given a great talk.  It was also such a supportive audience that they would have cheered us on even if we had stage fright.  So… until next time!
