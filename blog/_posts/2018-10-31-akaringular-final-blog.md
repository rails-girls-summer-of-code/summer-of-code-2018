As we write this blog , we can't help but think of all the amazing things that have happened to us in the past three months. It looks like yesterday when we kicked off RGSoC but in reality it is now 100 days.  RGSOC happened when we were trying to do some soul searching. Figuring out where to start and what to do with our lives. It was a door opener for us. A reason to dive deeper into tech and the open source community. We have made more than 1000 steps in our career growth.

Here are some of our highlights:

**1. Major Growth Curve**

   It was exciting and challenging at the same time. Exciting because positive things happened to us and Challenging because at times things got tough. Apart from becoming experts in version controlling using git and github , we have had a chance to understand RSpec testing, Microservices in Rails, Deployment on Heroku, Rollbar, Javascript, UI...The list is totally endless. But the bottom line is we now have more skills than we had three months ago.

**2. Our Networks have grown**

   Throughout the period we  met so many amazing people. Our supervisor Mr. Rammon is one person we cannot forget. He was very friendly and always checked on our progress. The RGSoC community became our second home. We exchanged ideas with our peers on how we could grow the community. EBwiki coaches had our backs and we will forever be grateful.

**3. Bond grew stronger**

   We became better friends. Together we burnt the midnight oil to make our code work. When we were happy about the work we had done, we would hang out together to relax and rejuvenate. We also attended events such as African Women in Tech Conference, Girls Get Geeky Kisumu, Nairuby Conference and Rails Girls Kampala and Nairobi events. Even when things were rocky we fixed them , like fetching water from the well when our taps ran dry. It was a really cool three months.

**4. Self Discovery**

   RGSoC has really helped us realize our areas of expertise. For Rachael,front-end was working great and Stella back-end seemed more friendly. Sometimes we wrote beautiful code and other days quite nasty code but our coach Rachel took that positively and gave us a recommendable advise on the way forward that really encouraged us to keep trying. We are planning to keep contributing to the project and reduce the issues to a manageable number.

## Life after RGSoC
The summer may have to an end, but to us it’s a continuity of a journey that we bagan three months ago. How will we use the skills and knowledge acquired during the period? We plan on mainting the pace. Learn something new each day and of course continue contributing to open source projects. We also plan on sharing the knowledge and encouraging others to apply for such great opportunities.
