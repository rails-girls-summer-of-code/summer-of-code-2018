# Who we are

![team sunshine photo](/img/blog/2018/2018-07-19-team-sunshine.jpg "team sunshine photo")
<div class="image-credits"><b>Team Sunshine: Sujin Lee & Gyujin Cho (image by Sujin Lee)</b></div>  

ÏïàÎÖïÌïòÏÑ∏Ïöî(annyeonghaseyo)! We are Sujin and Gyujin from 'Sunshine' team in Seoul, S.Korea. We are working for [Babel.js](https://babeljs.io/), an Open Source JavaScript Transpiler that converts cutting-edge JavaScript into plain old ES5 JavaScript that can run in any browser. 

We are full stack JavaScript developers who have common interests in UI development and interactive interfaces. Before jumping into the programming world, we were artists: Gyujin was a designer and Sujin was a musician. We love art, creativity and technology. Based on both sides of programming and art experiences, we say the process of making graphic design or composing a music piece is very similar to computer programming.

[Gyujin](https://twitter.com/MarinaGJCho) is a junior frontend engineer at [Ridibooks](https://ridibooks.com), South Korea's leading e-reading services company. Staring with ES6, she has used jQuery, Vue.js, React.js, and TypeScript last two years for company product.

[Sujin](https://twitter.com/sujinleeme) is a graduate student in Seoul National University and she has pursued her passions of music and programming with equal vigor, aiming to make creative work that inspires. Nowadays she is strongly interested in making interactive music applications using machine learning. She leads the Women Who Code Seoul Network and is trying to build a more diverse and inclusive tech community here in Korea. Everywhere she goes she always has a pair of running shoes with her to run.

# How we met
Last february, as soon as Sujin came across a news about the opening of the Rails Girls Summer of Code Applications, it just stuck in her mind. Sujin was confident that she could get a great opportunity to contribute to a real Open Source Software project as a member of Open Source ecosystem. After that Sujin searched for a like-minded team mate in Django Girls community in Seoul and Gyujin that's how we got on the same boat. We asked close senior engineers to be our team coaches and everyone eagerly accepted the request and this is how we formed Team Sunshine to start our open source journey. 

# What brings us to join RGSoC
It is certain that the numbers for women engineers in the tech industry are already pretty bleak, but the situation is even worse as far as participation in open source projects is concerned. Additionally, we thought there was no room for the entry level of developers in open source projects and we weren't familiar to open source community until we met RGSoC. Unfortunately, we couldn‚Äôt meet any woman open source contributor who works the world's leading repository of open-source code, in Korea. We were highly motivated by RGSoC's initiatives to bring more diversity into open source and last RGSoC fellows's successful stories boosted our confidence. And we couldn't be more thrilled to think that our code could be running on millions of computers! Yes, RGSoC is definitly worth it.

During our preparation for the RGSoC application, we had to pick candidate two projects. Among other projects, [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) was the best fit for our needs. We had already used ES6 features for mordern web development, experienced React for SPAs and moveover we have a passionate concern for the next generations of ES.

We also read a recent [Henry‚Äôs writing](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/were-nearing-the-7-0-babel-release-here-s-all-the-cool-stuff-we-ve-been-doing-8c1ade684039) published in free code camp medium. We were touched by the warmth of his welcome to Babel open source community. He says that "Babel is in a great position to be an educational tool for programmers so they can continue to learn how JavaScript works". We thought that  through contributing to the project, they can learn about Javascript core concepts such as ASTs, compilers, language specification. 

# Ta-da! What a surprise! 
One day in April, we had a video call from Ana and Ram√≥n from the RGSoC team. We felt a little nervous at the beginning of about 5 min, however, it fell from us very quickly because these two warmhearted supervisors made us feel very comfortable. Actually, we didn't think that we were successful in making them enthusiastic about us so that any of us were expecting to be able to get in.

Two weeks later, Ana and Vaishali requested a second round interview because the selection process had been a bit more demanding than previous editions. It ended up being a surprise call were we learned that we were accepted in RGSoC! üéâ We were thrilled with the good news and it was a moment we will never forget.

Babel is an open-sourced JavaScript compiler that leader companies like Facebook, Netflix, and Spotify and countless others adopt to ship software for the web. Babel not only allows developers to use the latest syntax in older browsers, but even has its role in shaping the future of the language itself due to its adoption in the community. The SPA frameworks like Angular, React, Vue, Ember also use Babel. It's downloaded more than 14 million times a month on npm. Isn't it amazing? ‚ú®

In Bable offical website, there is [Babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/), a playground for ES6; where user can write ES6 code, check the relevant code in ES5; and also the output.

Currently, the [Babel core team](https://babeljs.io/team) is going to replace CodeMirror to [Ives'](https://twitter.com/CompuIves) [CodeSandBox](https://codesandbox.io/), the new code online editor. An end goal is to show a different view of the output code: [AST](https://astexplorer.net/), output code, or [time travel](https://github.com/babel/babel-time-travel). We have just started to work for integration time travel in REPL and are going to contribute for UI development with help of our mentors and coaches.

The name 'PeachTree' comes from the tale of 'Romance of the Three Kingdoms'. Just like how Yubi, Gwanwoo and Jangbi pleged their brotherhood under the peach tree. We hope to cooperate in harmony each other in its space under the peach tree.

We have regular meeting with all members. Our team has 6 different time zones; Seoul, Lisbon, NY and more!
