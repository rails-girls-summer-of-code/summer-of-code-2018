Trees are changing colours of their leaves, kids have started school again and coffee chains are once again selling pumpkin flavoured coffee. That's a clear sign that the summer is now officially over, and so is our Rails Girls Summer of Code experience.

## What have we done

We feel like we have made a significant progress during our Rails Girls Summer of Code.
Here's the list of features we have written and other ways we have contributed to the KeystoneJS project:

* Wrote `max` characters option for the Text field
* Came up with `min` characters option for the Text field
* Implemented smooth scrolling after updating an item in Admin
* Wrote `complexity` option for the Password field
* Added `max` characters option for the Password field
* Reviewed and edited existing documentation, moving it back to the main repo
* Added missing documentation for `numberArray`, `dateArray` and `geoPoint` fields
* Documented the features we had written
* Wrote `twitter` field type
* Wrote a user guide for creating a blog with KeystoneJS
* Designed and coded the list visualization for the Admin

## What have we learned

We have become much more comfortable working with git. We both had some limited experience with it already, but contributing to an open source project is a whole different use case, so we gained some priceless insights and learned many useful commands (and practiced using them every day).

We are also a lot more confident about JavaScript; there were lots of lines of code that we have explored, analyzed, copy-pasted and, of course, also written from scratch.

Beside plain JavaScript and Node.js, we have also learned about ReactJS, Redux and Mongoose, by means of coaching sessions, reading documentation, working through online tutorials and self study.

Last but not least, we have exercised our patience, perseverance and determination when we were overcoming difficult and frustrating moments.

## What are our plans

Daria will now go back to her freelancing activities, but she will try to work on more challenging projects with the aim to transition into JavaScript frontend development.

Veronika had left her customer service job just before starting the Summer of Code, so now she is on a lookout for a new job, or possibly an internship opportunity. Hopefully she will find something soon and will continue on her path to becoming a better programmer.
