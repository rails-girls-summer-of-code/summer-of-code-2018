Hello awesome mentors!

We are back with RGSoC 2018. It gives us immense pleasure to announce that <b>our call for open source project submissions is now open, YAY!</b>

You might have questions about the project submissions, so we have it all covered for you here:

- What does it mean to be a mentor for RGSoC 2018?

  Usually a mentor is a maintainer of the proposed project (or a core contributor) and is the project’s dedicated contact person for the 
  team throughout the program. Checkout our [mentors guide](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/projects/) for more information.

- Our project doesn’t use Rails. Can we still apply to RGSoC?

  Yes. Even though our name use ‘Rails’ in our program, we are a language agnostic program, and we’ve had projects in the past using a
  variety of languages like Python, Rust, and Javascript. Projects in all programming languages and using all technologies are welcome! 

- When will we be informed about whether our project has been selected for RGSoC 2018?

  You have until <b>January 24, 2018</b> to submit your project; this year, we will be looking through all the submissions after the
  deadline, so you will be informed at the end of January.

So, what are you waiting for? Start right now and submit your project [here](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/). Use our [mentors guide](https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/projects/) and feel free to send us an email to <b>contact@rgsoc.org</b> if you have specific questions.

Also, don’t forget to share it on social media to help us make RGSoC 2018 the year with the most diverse selection of projects. May the force be with you!
