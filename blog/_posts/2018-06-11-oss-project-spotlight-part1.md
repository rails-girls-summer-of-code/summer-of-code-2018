A few weeks ago we launched [a small poll on twitter](https://twitter.com/RailsGirlsSoC/status/989527276646694913) to see if you were interested in knowing more about Open Source projects, diversity-and-inclusion-related initiatives and best practices on how to contribute to Open Source. The response was overwhelmingly positive and today we are marking the beginning of a new series of content dedicated to OSS projects. And what better way to start this than to celebrate the projects that are participating in RGSoC 2018?<br>
**We would like to introduce you to the OSS Project Spotlight**: a short summary of the projects to give you a glimpse of what each project is about. We hope you enjoy it and find this information useful!
