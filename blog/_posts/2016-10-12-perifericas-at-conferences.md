Can't believe RGSoC is done.
We've experienced three incredible months!

During Rails Girls Summer of Code we had the chance to participate in three events. And that's what we want to share with you in this post.

Some conferences only me (Geisa) could attend, so you might see comments in first person. >^.^<

<h3>Perifericas at I SECOMTEC 2016</h3>

We've been invited to give a talk about Rails Girls Summer of Code and our experience in the tech community at the first edition of [SECOMTEC](http://secomtec.ml/). This was also the first time Emma gave a talk, as a girl, for an audience. Super cool!

There's a recorded video [in portuguese](https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1635020893495036&id=1587530478244078&fs=5), which, unfortunately, is not complete. You can check the slides from the talk at [this link](http://perifericas.github.io/secomtec16), but it's in Portuguese too.

Our coach X was there too, talking about [Assembly](https://lampiaosec.github.io/talks/Asm/#/) and reverse engineering. I mediate a panel with professionals women from Engineering and Tech. It was really great to hear about their experiences and point of views.

<h3>Perifericas at Jusbrasil Tech Day</h3>

On the 2nd of September, I was at [Jusbrasil Tech Day](https://medium.com/@tupydabahia/jusbrasil-tech-day-2-de-setembro-2016-32b56c8b86dd#.rni7glrst), a comemorative event for the 5 years of Jusbrasil - one of the most promising companies in Bahia and the one of the most accessible [legal portals in Brazil](http://www.jusbrasil.com.br/home).

They support the local Tech community. The first edition of [Rails Girls Salvador](http://railsgirls.com/salvador201310) was held there.
It was an opportunity to meet my friends and learn about Docker, Continuous Delivery, project management and others topics, so it was really great.

<h3>Perifericas at RubyConf Brazil</h3>

Oh, how I loved to be there!  
So many great talks, so many friends, so many new people I got to meet. My first [RubyConf Brazil](http://www.rubyconf.com.br/). Yay!

I was able to watch international talks with President Beef from [Breakman](http://brakemanscanner.org) (that coach Brena indicated) and Akira Matsuda about Ruby international community. There are so many tips and tools that I want to share with Speakerinnen's team and use in future projects.

**Did I mention 3 conferences?  
Well, there's one more! Like a bonus. :)**<br>

<h3>Perifericas at VI EnSI</h3>

The last conference we've attended was EnSI, a conference about Security.
At [EnSI](https://ensi.pop-ba.rnp.br/2016/) we attended some talks about privacy and data, shared point of views with other professionals about how to prevent attacks. It's a topic that really gets our attention, everyday.

And now we've been back to our activities as community leaders, so there are more conferences coming.

We learned a lot and the opportunity to engage more with the community was really important to us.

Thanks to all organizers! It's has been a pleasure to talk about RGSoC and meet more professionals in brazilian tech community.
