It's September 19th and we are less than two weeks away for RGSoC to be over — this is probably the countdown we are least fond of. However, as we approach September 30th, we realize how many good things came up from the summer like the community support and the amazing growth of our students. We couldn't be more proud of them! And we also couldn't be more thankful of everyone's dedication to our students and RGSoC.

So let's celebrate all of this! Let's celebrate us getting together and making tech and OSS more inclusive for everyone! Let's celebrate making dreams come true! Wherever we are, let's organize an event — it can be big or small — and invite our friends. We created a list on [this repo](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/announcements), so that you can add your even info or check for information about any events in your location.

Another important thing: let's keep in touch! When you publish your posts on social media about the events or even messages that you want to share about the summer of code, please add the hashtag #RGSoC so that we can all see it.
