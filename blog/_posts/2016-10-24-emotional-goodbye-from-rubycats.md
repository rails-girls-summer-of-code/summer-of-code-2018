**It has been an amazing journey!**

We are still shocked how emotional and draining the whole experience was. But mostly it was a dream come true.

We haven't accomplished what we set out to do. But we are happy of the things we did and what we've learned.

We don't know what the future will bring. We will try our best to learn more and hope for the best. We will continue our path, even if it's rocky.



##### **Few words from each of us:**

**Iza:**
The end of RGSoC was very hard for me. RGSoC was a time I felt I was living the life the way I want to live it. Now I'm trying to pick myself up and collect the pieces of my life's puzzle. Not sure what the picture looks like, but I'm determined to put the pieces together.
 
**Kinga:**
The end of RGSoC was like waking up from a beautiful dream into life as usual. I'd like this dream to last forever. 

It's like in Fort Minor song *Where did you go*:

>Where'd you go?
>I miss you so,
>Seems like it's been forever,
>That you've been gone.
>Please come back home...

I hope I'll become a professional developer one day (soon!) and then this dream will be back. For now I got back to teaching kids about programming, which I really like. But without being a programmer I won't be fulfilled.

And now like in a song *Oxalá* by my beloved Madredeus:

>Oxalá meu futuro aconteça (I hope my future will happen)

I still have a lot to learn and do. Mission not accomplished and not aborted. Mission in progress. Some Teams App code still needs to be completed / included into a PR.
