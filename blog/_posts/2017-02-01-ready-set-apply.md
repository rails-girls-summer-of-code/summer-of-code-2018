*[Edit: We've extended the application deadline until **March 8th 2017, 18:00 UTC**.]*

Do you want to spend three months coding on Open Source projects? Then this is for you! February 1st is finally here, and **we will be opening our applications later today, at 18:00 UTC**. You will have exactly **one month** to fill out and place your application; applications will close on Wednesday March 1st, 2017 at 18:00 UTC. Here is our [application guide](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/students/application/). 

Before you get started, let’s make sure you’ve got everything ready to go to work on your application; we’ve summarised the steps you need to take before creating an application below.

### Who can apply?  

<div class="smaller">

</div>

<br>
We are looking for applicants who are available **for 3 months (from July 1st to September 30th) to work full-time** on an Open Source project and who are proficient in English. Because of our strong focus on community, we expect applicants to be involved with their programming communities (through meetups, workshops or conferences) and to have one year of continued programming learning experience.  
We welcome applications from all people who identify as women and non-binary.

### Find a pair  

<div class="smaller">

</div>

<br>
One of the main requirements for applying is **having a team mate who lives in the same city as you** and with whom you can meet up every day to work. It’s not only important to find a pair; you should also make sure you get along and will be able to work together closely during the summer.  
Don’t know how to find a pair? Take a look at our [finding your team](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/students/finding-your-team/) guide. 

### Find coaches  

<div class="smaller">
<img src="/img/blog/2017/2017-02-01-coaches.jpg">
</div>

<br>
Teams are required to have **at least two coaches (either local or remote)** who can help them on a regular basis. Coaches are developers who will sit down with you and help you understand important concepts or provide help when you get stuck. Local coaches are not a requirement, but we still would recommend trying to find local coaches before you reach out to possible remote coaches.  
Still looking for coaches? Take a look at our [finding your team](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/students/finding-your-team/) guide. 

### Find a coaching company / workspace

<div class="smaller">

</div>

<br>
A coaching company provides your team with a place to work from during the summer; you’ll get office space and a team of coaches. **Coaching companies are a good asset to have**, so if you know any local companies who might be interested in hosting you, try reaching out to them and share our [guide for coaching companies](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/coaching-company/).  
If finding a coaching company is not possible, working in a co-working space or a university space are also options for good work spaces.

### Find a project

<div class="smaller">
<img src="/img/blog/2017/2017-02-01-project.jpg">
</div>

<br>
We require all teams to apply for RGSoC with a project from our [accepted projects list](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects). Each project lists the technologies used and additional requirements in order to apply with that project, such as prior knowledge or coding challenges to solve.  
You should pick a project both you and your team mate are interested in working on; don’t hesitate to ask your coaches for assistance when choosing a project: are they familiar with the project? Do they think it would be a good fit?  

### Apply

Got a team mate, coaches, a place to work from, and a project? Then you’re pretty much ready to create an application; please make sure you’ve read everything in the [Application Guide](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/students/application/) before you do so. For the application, we use our very own [Teams app](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/); you will need to log in via GitHub to create an account. In the application guide you will find more detailed application on creating a team a filling out your application.  
You will have time until **March 1st, 2017 at 18:00 UTC** to submit your application. **Any applications submitted after that date will not be considered.**

If you encounter any problems or have any questions during the application process, we’ve got a [handy help page](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/pages/help) to guide you; if that still doesn’t answer your questions, you can hop into our [Student support slack channel](https://rgsoc-student-application.herokuapp.com/) to get help.

Good luck with your applications — ready, set, apply!
