It is the end of an incredible summer. We improved our skills so far and attended our first conference, [RubyConf Colombia](http://www.rubyconf.co/). We are very grateful with the program of Rails Girls Summer of Code.

At the beginning of this summer we had high expectations about what we might do. We read, did so many tutorials, we investigated and especially, we coded, considering that practice is most important thing when you are learning to code. So we decided to absorb all the necessary knowledge of our supervisor, mentors and coaches and see for ourselves the satisfaction to see our complete project and that's priceless.

We can say that this is a new beginning, although three months were not enough now we have more confidence to start new projects and be more active in the open source community. We want to express our gratitude to the program's organizers, our supervisor **Ramon Huidobro**, our coaches **Sebastian Sogamoso** and **Alfonso Mancilla**, and mentors **Nick Quaranto** and **Benjamin Fleischer**, who were always willing to help.

Last week we attended the RubyConf Colombia, which was amazing! Especially Angela, who lived this experience as an organizer.

The atmosphere in an event like this is indescribable. You're surrounded by great people, from whom you can learn a lot. All you want is to just hear everything they say and not miss a word. There were four women speakers (Woohoo!!) with very motivational talks.

This year the conference was held in parallel with the [JSConf Colombia](http://jsconf.co/) at the same place, we also had the opportunity to attend, and were very excited after the last keynote. In it, the organizers made a homage to the women in tech, exalting all the work we have done to make progress in this sector.

Finally, we want to thank all the [organizers](http://www.rubyconf.co/#organizers) who made these conferences possible, especially RubyConf Co, which is the first time that was realized in Colombia. All speakers were very excited and were saying they definitely would come for a second edition, to which we also look forward!
