When we said [After RGSoC is before RGSoC](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2016-10-05-after-rgsoc-is-before-rgsoc) we really meant it! Just 2 months after RGSoC 2016 is finished we‚Äôre ready to announce that <b>Open Source Projects Submissions are OPEN for RGSoC 2017</b>.

<b>You have until January 31st, 2017 to apply in the [RGSoC Teams App](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects/new).</b>

Even though our name has the word ‚ÄúRails‚Äù in it, <b>our Summer of Code accepts ALL programming languages.</b> So, whether your project is in Python, Javascript, Elixir, Go, Django, Ruby, Java, NodeJS, or PHP ‚Äî you can still apply!

If you would like to know more about submitting a project or being a mentor during our summer of code, please take a look at our [‚ÄúBecoming a Project Mentor‚Äù](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/guide/projects/) guide. You can also send us an email to [contact@rgsoc.org](mailto:contact@rgsoc.org) if you have specific questions.

You may have noticed that this year you will have two full months to submit your project; this will give everyone more time to think things through and will hopefully help us reach as many project maintainers as possible.
