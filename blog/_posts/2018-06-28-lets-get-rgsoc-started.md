Rails Girls Summer of Code is about to begin! All these months of preparation, from submitting the OSS Projects, to finding the coaches and applying to the program; fundraising and selecting the teams; a “You are Accepted to RGSoC” surprise video and an extra 5 teams that we managed to welcome… We could be tired of listing all of these things, but we are over the moon — or shall we say “over the sun”, — to kick off another year of our summer of code. We hope you are as thrilled as we are!

<br>
<span class="color-red">Organize a kick off event in your location</span>

This year, as we usually do, we would like to invite you to organize a kick off event in your location. You can organize something low key with your friends or your RGSoC team (teammate, coaches, mentors, etc.), or something open to your whole local community — it’s up to you.
The Kick Off events list is in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/announcements/issues), so feel free to add an issue with all the info of your event there.

<br>
<span class="color-red">And there is going to be a live stream!</span>

Actually, two livestreams! Next Monday, July 2nd, to celebrate the first day of the program, we will be hosting two worldwide livestreams. Everyone who is part of RGSoC 2018 is invited to join and say hi. The goal is to give us an opportunity to meet each other, beyond slack messages and GitHub comments. If you want to join, please check your inbox for the invites.

IMPORTANT NOTE: We will be filming some bits of the call, if you don’t want to be filmed, but you still want to say hi, please send us an email to contact@rgsoc.org to let us know and we’ll figure something out. :)

Happy summer of code!
