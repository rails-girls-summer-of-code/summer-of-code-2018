    <p>Rails Girls Summer of Code enables women and non-binary people to work on Open Source projects from July to September each year while receiving a monthly scholarship. You can help make this a reality by becoming a Rails Girls Summer of Code sponsor or by donating as an individual.</p>
    <p>We offer various packages with different perks, as outlined below.</p>

    <h2>Why you should become a sponsor</h2>

    <p>Sponsoring Rails Girls Summer of Code helps individual women and non-binary people get into Open Source, but it also comes with benefits for the community at large.</p>

    <h2>Sponsorship Packages</h2>
    <p>Supporting RGSoC enables our students to dedicate themselves to their Open Source learning projects full-time because their living expenses are covered by a monthly stipend.</p>

    <p>As a sponsor, you are a crucial part of providing the Rails Girls Summer of Code stipends. Your sponsorship will enter into a budget pool from which the selected students will be paid.</p>

    <p>If you would like to know more about RGSoC or present our program to your company, you can also take a look at this <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/langziehohr/rails-girls-summer-of-code-2017">pitch deck</a>.</p>

    <h3>Company swag in student support packages</h3>

    <p>If you send us your swag, we will include it in a “care package” that will be sent out to each student. Bronze sponsors are very welcome to send stickers or other small items that fit into an envelope. Silver sponsors and upwards may send additional swag (e.g. pens, notebooks, webcam covers or other things that fit nicely with a Summer of Code learning project).</p>

    <h3>Your company in the <em>Sponsor opportunity Newsletter</em></h3>

    <p>You may want to offer opportunities to our students such as (but not limited to) internships, interviews, special use of your services, invitations to events etc.</p>

    <p>We are collecting all these offers and will display them in order of sponsorship packages in an informative newsletter, which goes out to all our participants towards the end of the program.</p>

    <h3>Your logo on slides at presentations about RGSoC</h3>

    <p>Students are strongly encouraged to give full talks or lightning talks at conferences (many of which donate free tickets for them), as well as local programming and tech meetups. Students present their projects and explain how Rails Girls Summer of Code is helping them do it.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, some of our organisers also hold presentations about the program as a whole.</p>

    <p>All people presenting on behalf of or in conjunction with Summer of Code are asked to include a slide with all Gold and Platinum sponsors’ logos at the beginning of their presentation.</p>
