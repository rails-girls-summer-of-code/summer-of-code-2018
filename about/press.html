      <h3>About Rails Girls Summer of Code</h3>
      <p>
      Rails Girls Summer of Code is a scholarship that funds women and non-binary people around the world to spend three months working full-time on open-source software projects. Modelled after Google Summer of Code, but with a focus on advanced beginners wanting to go into programming full-time, Rails Girls Summer of Code aims to get women and non-binary people involved in open-source. It’s the first ever program of its kind in the world. Despite its name, RGSoC is also programming language agnostic.
      </p>
      <p>
      Since the program’s inception in 2013, over 960 individuals all over the world have applied and RGSoC has supported more than 180 students over the years. Recently, a survey conducted by RGSoC revealed that 90% of the students are still working in tech today and 8% have founded their own startups. 55% of those students still regularly contribute to Open Source projects.
      </p>

      <p>
      In 2017, over 190 teams applied for the program, more than doubling RGSoC's 2016 record! A total of <a href="https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/projects">50 Open Source projects</a> were accepted for that edition.
      </p>

      <p>
      Contributing to Open Source Projects is at the <a href="http://foundation.travis-ci.org/2016/08/19/rgsoc/">core of RGSoC</a>. RGSoC students have contributed to more than 60 Open Source projects such as Bundler, Rails, Discourse, Sinatra, Diaspora, impress.js, Lektor CMS, Hoodie, Speakerinnen, Lotus (now Hanami) and Servo. This is a very important factor, as only 11% of Open Source Project contributors are women.
      </p>
      <p>
      Since its inception, RGSoC has been supported by companies like Travis CI, GitHub, Google, GitLab, Envato, Basecamp and SoundCloud, to name a few. At the same time, thousands of people have backed this initiative individually. In 2016, RGSoC raised 117,425 USD and in order to thank everyone who has contributed to the program, launched the <a href="http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/blog/2016-04-22-thank-you-lets-diversify-tech">#diversifytech</a> campaign.
      </p>

I learned to use relevant tools in a team environment and what a workflow can look like. Those are valuable experiences that help me in the internship I do today.”

          “A very nice part of Rails Girls Summer of Code was that they handled free tickets to conferences. This is how I got to go to ArrrrCamp in Gent, Belgium and give a talk. That was a way to spread the knowledge about RGSoC and at the same time, a call to organize Rails Girls Brussels since I could find no girl to form a team. By the end of the conference, I had a bunch of developers interested to help and coach and also I was introduced to my current company :) so, tl;dr life changing!”

          “How Rails Girls Summer Of Code helps us to learn to code is that it is not just about learning code, it’s about having best practices such as daily standups, test driven development, well maintained code, and elegant solutions. Culture Amp have helped us jumpstart our career in software development by challenging us to ask the right questions in order to get the answers we need, and to learn how to find essential information. Their lunchtime Brown Bag sessions on tech topics such as Github and Docker have given us real world education in issues that affect them. We’ve also noticed that our open source contribution graphs on Github are so much greener! It’s been a great opportunity for networking and meeting people within the company, and finding out about the culture of a company that cares greatly about what culture is.”

Women learning new things and getting their foot in the door are only the tip of the iceberg. This program also alters mindsets of people around, setting new standards of how the tech community should look. Year by year, we spread the idea of diversifying tech to make today's diversity challenges build up tomorrow's new reality, where diversity is just a normal and usual state of things. This is what we aim for.”

RGSoC is the amazing group of people that is just there for them. We create the conditions, but we also encourage, push and challenge them. RGSoC is not just about improving diversity statistics, it’s about welcoming and supporting newcomers into tech in the best way possible.”

           “Over my 5-year career in tech, I have helped organise four Rails Girls workshops but this was my first time as a coach for RGSoC. Being connected with the Rails Girls Organisation has been, by far, one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, to be able to give back to the tech community that has given me so much. We all talk, debate, complain about the lack of women in tech, but very few actually get up and do something about. Cheers to RGSoC for encouraging young women so, and letting people like me do our bit to help.”

           “Everybody who holds some professional knowledge has the responsibility of "giving back" — an axiom of education. For me, personally, contributing to RGSoC, i.e. by coaching, is an opportunity of doing so and share knowledge I gathered since I started thinking about computer programs. And it's not a one-way motorway: The process of coaching/teaching is highly omnidirectional. Increasing knowledge of students is the most visible part, but it also holds a mirror to the people teaching. It triggers fruitful discussions and lets new ideas emerge. It implicitly lets the coaches reflect, question and sharpen their methods and techniques every time again.”

           “I was a student during Rails Girls Summer of Code 2015 and had an even better time than I’d hoped when I applied — it was amazing to find myself surrounded by so many supportive, motivated and helpful people all over the globe, as coaches, mentors, fellow students or just friendly people who were happy to help. So this year, I was very happy to participate again, this time as a supervisor — both because I wanted to pass on some of the help I received last year by helping another team have a great summer, and because I wanted to continue being part of this wonderful community! What I really enjoy about RGSoC is that it encourages everyone, no matter their level of knowledge or role, to get out there and do their best — to go from curiosity to real coding, to get involved, pass on knowledge, ignore imposter syndrome and jump right in.”

That’s 140 new and different perspectives to tackling engineering challenges. And 140 more role models for women in technology. We can’t wait!"
